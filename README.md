## This repository
> In this course we created a server and configured all the necessary files to do frontend render from the server.
## Introduction

#### What is Server Side Rendering?
> Server-side rendering (SSR), is the ability of an application to contribute by displaying the web-page on the server instead of rendering it in the browser. Server-side sends a fully rendered page to the client; the client’s JavaScript bundle takes over and allows the SPA framework to operate. There is also client-side rendering which slows down the procedure of viewing and interacting with the web page.

## Advantages
> - It enables pages to load faster which provides a better user experience.
> - It plays an important role in SEO (search engine optimization) and correctly indexes webpages. This happens because Google favors web pages with faster load time.
> - It provides body to the HTML pages for all server ships.
> - It assists with loading the page when the user has a slow internet connection.
> - It assists in loading the page when the user has an outdated device.
